# Basic Projects for Programming an Arduino
A few simple Arduino projects for connecting components, such as LEDs, buttons &amp; buzzers.

## Traffic Control System (traffic1.ino)
Control traffic with a traffic light system with East/West flow control.

**You will need**:
+ 2 Red LEDs
+ 2 Amber/Yellow LEDs
+ 2 Green LEDs
+ 2 Push-to-Make (PTM) buttons

_Be sure to change the integer constants defined at the start of the program to the pin numbers each component is connected to._

## Model Car Lighting System (BasicCar.ino)
Add indicators, headlights, fog lights and brake lights to mode cars.

**You will need**:
+ 4 White/Clear LEDs
+ 2 Amber/Yellow LEDs
+ 2 Red LEDs
+ 5 Push-to-Make (PTM) buttons

_Be sure to change the integer constants defined at the start of the program to the pin numbers each component is connected to._
